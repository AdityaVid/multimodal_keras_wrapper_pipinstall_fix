# Multimodal Keras Wrapper
Wrapper for Keras with support to easy data and models loading and handling.


## Documentation

You can access the library documentation page at [marcbs.github.io/multimodal_keras_wrapper/](http://marcbs.github.io/multimodal_keras_wrapper/)

Some code examples are available in demo.ipynb and test.py. Additionally, in the section Projects you can see some practical examples of projects using this library.


## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for using this library:

 - [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
 - Keras - [custom fork](https://github.com/MarcBS/keras) or [original version](https://github.com/fchollet/keras)
 - [cloud](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloud/2.7.2) >= 2.8.5


## Installation

In order to install the library you just have to follow these steps:

1) Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/MarcBS/multimodal_keras_wrapper.git
```
2) Include the repository path into your PYTHONPATH:
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/multimodal_keras_wrapper
```

## Projects

You can see more practical examples in projects which use this library:

[VIBIKNet for Visual Question Answering](https://github.com/MarcBS/VIBIKNet)

[ABiViRNet for Video Description](https://github.com/lvapeab/ABiViRNet)

[Sentence-SelectioNN for Domain Adaptation in SMT](https://github.com/lvapeab/sentence-selectioNN)


## Keras

For additional information on the Deep Learning library, visit the official web page www.keras.io or the GitHub repository https://github.com/fchollet/keras.

You can also use our [custom Keras version](https://github.com/MarcBS/keras), which provides several additional layers for Multimodal Learning.
